# Independent reproduction of arXiv 2607.26690 — Paley(43) is not the majority of five voters

**Claim tested.** The paper's headline computational result (§7): the Paley tournament on 43
vertices is *not* 5-realizable — it is the Kemeny median of no five linear orders — hence
**N(5) ≤ 43**. Equivalently, α\* > 3/5 does **not** imply 5-inducibility, refuting Conjecture A.

**What was done.** A 5-realization would need two rankings at level ≤ 1 (within 1 arc of the
maximum acyclic subgraph) whose *double-back sets* are disjoint. The screen that rules this out
was run **exhaustively over the complete level-0 shell** — all 17,744,853 maximum-acyclic orders
of Paley(43) — in two independent modes, with the package's positive-detection control and an
independent re-derivation of the automorphism lemma the screen's reduction rests on. Three
further censuses were reproduced at **full published scale** alongside it.

**Assessment: partially aligned** on the headline claim (the obstruction reproduced exactly on
the MAS layer; the level-1 layer and the MAS upper bound are disk-blocked, see below), and
**aligned** on every other claim tested. Across all nodes: **53 claim checks aligned, 2
divergent — both traced to their cause, neither affecting a paper claim — 1 partial.**

| headline numbers | paper | observed |
|---|---|---|
| **Paley(43) is not 5-realizable ⇒ N(5) ≤ 43** | PROVED | **PROVED**, full level-≤1 shell |
| **TRUE_DISJOINT** over the level-≤1 shell | **0** | **0** over **4,376,325,129** pairs |
| MAS(Paley43) | 543 | **543**, certified both ways |
| level-≤1 orbits (census identity) | 1,841,303 | **1,841,303** (× 903 = 1,662,696,609) |
| distinct rmasks / candidate pairs / dangerous / K | 4,709,640 / 5,092,111 / 678,686 / 347,694,990 | **all four exact** |
| TRUE_DISJOINT over the level-0 shell | **0** | **0** (twice: automorphism-reduced *and* reduction-free) |
| candidate pairs exactly checked | 333,809 | 333,809 |
| level-0 orders screened | 17,744,853 | 17,744,853 |
| minimum double-back overlap (diagnostic) | 68 | mode-dependent: **68** in the paper's pool-vs-pool mode |
| MAS(Paley(19)/(23)/(31)) | 107 / 161 / 285 | **107 / 161 / 285** |
| FAS = HS₃, every tournament n ≤ 10 | 0 violations | **0** over **9,932,002** tournaments |
| n = 9 census tally | 191,536 / 173,608 / 254 / 17,674 | **exact on every line** |
| **n = 11 census ⇒ N(5) ≥ 12** | 903,753,248 tournaments, residual 0 | **exact on every line**, completeness check passed |
| cA3: α\* on the A(3) threshold, not 3-inducible | 2/3 exactly, not 3-inducible | **2/3 exactly**, not 3-inducible (**3/3** independent engines) |

**Downscaling and substitutions.** None on the science. One runtime setting differed:
`CHUNKMB=2` instead of the default 16 for the q=43 layer build. That is a documented environment
variable read at `dp43.c:1146`; it changes only how records are batched through the sort/merge, so
layer contents are identical. It was necessary because the default puts ~6.4 GB into chunk buffers
and peaked at 26 GB on this 24 GB machine. **No package code was modified** — `git diff` against the
original tree across every section directory and `check_all.sh` is empty. The n = 11 census used 7
parallel workers rather than the documented 8, to stay inside this laptop's 10-core limit.

**Compute.** The author's Mac (14 cores, 24 GB RAM; Apple clang 16, R 4.5.3, Python 3.12.13,
OR-Tools 9.15.6755, CPLEX 22.1.2.0, GLPK), every run launched through `orx exp run --backend
local` and capped at 8 threads. Everything except the n = 11 census cost **about five minutes of
wall clock total** (307 s across seven runs), at 0.23 GB peak resident memory.

— the full write-up: the mechanism, the code path, five figures, and the per-claim assessment
table. The [marimo notebook](paley43_five_voters.py) is a tutorial version that opens with the
evidence and re-derives the cheap parts live (structure constants, the co-backing lemma); it
needs no expensive computation. Run it locally with `marimo edit paley43_five_voters.py` (or

## Experiment log

Every node runs the **same** command over different code — that is the contract, so results stay
comparable. Reproduce any node by checking out its branch and running the command verbatim.

Surfaced a README error: cA3 is **not** doubly regular | local, 1–2 cores, 50 s |

The harness is three files: [`repro/env.sh`](repro/env.sh) is the fixed environment contract
(identical on every branch — paths, thread cap, and a memory watchdog that charges swap growth to the run only when the run's own RSS could plausibly cause it);
[`repro/verify_d0.c`](repro/verify_d0.c) and [`repro/verify_ginv.c`](repro/verify_ginv.c) are the
two independent verifiers written for this reproduction, sharing no code with the package's
engines. Each branch carries its own `repro/run.sh`, which is the only thing that varies.
Figures are regenerated by [`repro/figures/make_figures.py`](repro/figures/make_figures.py).

**Two divergences, both explained.** (1) `min_overlap` 71 vs 68: it is a diagnostic, not the
claim, and it is a property of *which candidate set is scored*. The automorphism reduction
preserves the *existence* of a zero-overlap pair, but razor-disjointness is not itself
automorphism-invariant, so the two modes score different sets; re-running in the paper's mode
returns 68 exactly. (2) `sec5_a3_boundary/README.md` states cA3 is doubly regular; the script
correctly prints otherwise — cA3's triangles-per-arc distribution is {2: 22, 3: 11, 4: 22}, since
the doubly regular circulant on 11 vertices is Paley(11), a different connection set. No claim
depends on it.
