        # Can five voters produce any ranking?

        A tutorial walk through the central claim of
        [*Tournaments determined by three and five voters*](https://arxiv.org/abs/2607.26690)
        (Chindelevitch & Harutyunyan, arXiv 2607.26690) and its reproduction on a laptop.

        **The result, first.** A five-voter realization of the Paley tournament on 43 vertices
        would need two of its rankings to disagree in completely non-overlapping places. Among
        all 157 trillion available pairs, not one qualifies — the nearest miss still overlaps
        in 68 places.

        <img src="{IMG}fig1_level0_funnel.png" width="900" />

        Everything below explains what that means and re-derives the cheap parts live. Nothing
        in this notebook runs an expensive computation: the exhaustive screens were run
        separately (9 s and 11 s on 8 threads) and their results are quoted as data.

    ## The setup

    Give **m voters**, each a strict ranking of **n options**. For each pair of options,
    let the majority decide. The result assigns a direction to every pair — a
    **tournament**. Which tournaments can arise this way?

    Every tournament arises from *some* number of voters, so the sharp question is:

    > **N(k)** = the smallest number of options for which *some* tournament is **not**
    > the majority of k voters.

    Below N(k), k voters are universal. The paper brackets N(5) from both sides. This
    notebook follows the upper bound: an explicit 43-vertex tournament that five voters
    cannot produce, giving **N(5) ≤ 43**.

    ### Predictability, and the conjecture that fails

    Let *C* be the number of pairs and **MAS(T)** the largest number of pairs a single
    ranking can get right. Then

    $$\alpha^*(T) = \mathrm{MAS}(T)/C$$

    measures how nearly T is itself a ranking. A short count shows
    $\alpha^* \ge (k+1)/2k$ is **necessary** for k-inducibility. *Conjecture A* said it was
    also sufficient. The paper refutes that at k = 3 and at k = 5 — and Paley(43) is the
    k = 5 witness: it clears the threshold and still cannot be realized.

    ## Why only a sliver of the 43! rankings can matter

    There are $43! \approx 6\times10^{52}$ possible voters, so a brute-force search is
    hopeless. Two facts cut it down to a finite check.

    ### Fact 1 — counting pins the top two voters

    Every arc must be forward in at least 3 of the 5 voters, so the five forward-counts
    sum to at least $3C$. Each is at most MAS. With MAS(Paley43) = 543 — certified by the

        {forced_level} of the maximum). That shell is finite.

        And the density test does *not* save Paley(43) — it passes it:

    ## How the exhaustive check is made tractable

    The level-0 shell alone holds 17,744,853 maximum-acyclic rankings — about
    $1.57\times10^{14}$ pairs. Two devices, both proved sound in the paper's §6, bring that
    to seconds. Neither can hide a disjoint pair.

    **The razor.** Fix a 24-vertex window $W = \{0,\dots,23\}$ and let $R$ be the 3-cycles
    lying wholly inside it (|R| = 538). Then $\mathrm{rmask}(O) = \mathrm{DB}(O)\cap R$
    depends only on how $O$ orders $W$, so the shell collapses to 124,406 distinct rmasks.
    If two rmasks overlap the full double-back sets certainly overlap — so only
    *razor-disjoint* pairs are candidates.

    **The automorphism reduction.** $|\mathrm{DB}(\sigma O_1)\cap \mathrm{DB}(\sigma O_2)|$
    is invariant under $G = \{x \mapsto ax+b : a \text{ a quadratic residue}\}$, of order
    903, so testing orbit representatives against the pool suffices — a factor 903 off one
    side.

    Both were re-checked in the reproduction: the invariance lemma over **all 903 σ**
    (0 violations in 1,598,310 checks), and G's action on the 3311 triangles giving 5
    orbits of sizes 903, 903, 903, 301, 301 with 602 triangles carrying a nontrivial
    stabiliser — the paper's figures exactly.
